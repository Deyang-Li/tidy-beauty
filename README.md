# tidy-beauty
This project is developed by four master students from the University of Canterbury in the 2nd semester of 2019.

The aim of our project is to use `R` and `Julia` two langauages to scrape, clean, store, analyze and visualize wild data. We use the knowledge and skills learnt from the Data Wrangling course recently and other materials online. All of our work is finished independently, except the part especially marked. If you are interested in this project, please contact us.
